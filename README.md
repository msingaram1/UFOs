# UFOs

### Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana, a data journalist very interested in anything space related, specifically UFO's. She wants to create a webpage to showcase UFO sighting data from her hometown which is held in a javascript file. To finalize the webpage, CSS and Bootstrap was used to build and style the page. A table organizing the UFO data from the JavaScript file is provided on the webpage that filters the data based on several search critieria. 

### Results 

The data is filtered by date, city, state, country and shape. The user can begin a search of the data for any of these critierion and whatever data results correspond with that input will be displayed. 

### Summary

This analysis is a good tool to sort out the UFO data from Dana's hometown. Two more updates that the page can use is of course additional filters like coordinates (lat, long) or if any pictures of the UFO sighting exist, also there could be a forum for like-minded individuals to chat with each other. One drawback of the website is it is only pulling data from a limitied database, if the database is continually updated with any new info that is found currnt or past it would be even more effective.
